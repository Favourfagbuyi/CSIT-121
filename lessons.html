    <h2>My Reflection</h2>

    <p>
        Completing this project honestly felt like putting together everything I have learned
        all semester in one project. There were moments where things I did not understand did not work at first, especially with
        layout and validation but I kept going back to previous labs, and that helped a lot.
        Every lab basically built the foundation for this final project, so once I understood
        how to structure pages correctly, everything else started falling into place.

        Testing on multiple browsers and my phone was interesting because things I thought
        looked fine on desktop did not look the same on mobile at all. I was so surprised. It really showed me why
        responsive design matters. Using media queries made a huge difference, and now I
        understand why every modern site needs them. Astonishing what one line of code can do!
    </p>

        Overall, this course taught me a lot from basic HTML structure all the way to
        accessibility, ARIA, mobile first layouts, and better coding habits. I can see the
        progress from Lab 1 till now. This final project wrapped everything together and made me
        feel more confident working with HTML and CSS.
