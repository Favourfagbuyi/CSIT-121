      <p>My first webpage! At first, the process seemed hard to be quite frank it was hard
         with so many tags to remember, but step by step it got easier. 
         I learned how to structure HTML and understand how webpages are built.
         It still takes me a while to remember everything/finish labs, but I'm getting there!</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>I learned about web standards</li>
        <li>How to use HTML to make a page</li>
        <li>The proper tags to use when making an HTML file</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Learning about x, y, and z was another exciting step. I learned a lot from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ccbcmd.brightspace.com" target="_blank">this page</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org" target="_blank">and this page</a></li>
      </ul>
