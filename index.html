            <p>
                I am studying Information Technology and taking courses like CSIT 121 
                to build my skills in programming and web development. After CCBC, I plan
                to transfer to Towson University. I'm also here to gain
                more knowledge in the field of computer science.

                and watching shows and sports, and reading books in my free time.
