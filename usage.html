    <p>Developers use WAI-ARIA by adding properties, states, and roles to HTML elements.  
       For example, a custom button made with a <code>div</code> can be given <code>role="button"</code> and an <code>aria-label</code> so screen readers recognize it as a button.  
       Dropdown menus often use <code>aria-expanded</code> to indicate whether a menu is open or closed. This is crucial for users who cannot see visual cues. 
       These attributes help users who rely on assistive technologies navigate interactive components easily.  
       ARIA makes complex websites understandable for all users.</p>

    <p>Another common example is marking live content updates using <code>aria-live</code>.  
       This lets screen readers announce new messages or alerts in real-time, such as chat notifications or form validation messages.  
       sliders, tabs, and modal dialogs also use ARIA roles to communicate structure and purpose.  They provide context that might not be clear from HTML alone.
       Without ARIA, these elements could be invisible or confusing to screen reader users.  
       Proper usage ensures a smooth and consistent user experience for all users.</p>

    <p>Using ARIA effectively requires understanding the purpose of each attribute.  
       For instance, <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> can hide decorative content from assistive technologies, preventing unnecessary announcements.  
       Combining ARIA with semantic HTML creates strong, accessible interfaces.  
       Practicing with ARIA has helped me see the difference between visually appealing websites and truly inclusive websites.  It has made me more aware of accessibility challenges and solutions.
       It is all about making sure every user can interact with the page as intended. You want all users to have a seamless experience.</p>
