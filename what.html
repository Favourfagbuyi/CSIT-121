    <p>WAI-ARIA stands for Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications.  
       It is a standard developed by the W3C that helps people who use screen readers and other assistive technologies understand web content better.
       Since the web has evolved to include more dynamic and interactive elements, traditional HTML alone sometimes falls short in conveying the necessary information to all users.  
       Many modern websites use custom buttons, menus, or interactive components that are not accessible by default.  
       Essentially, it acts like a translator between the website and tools that assist users with disabilities.</p>

    <p>ARIA does not visually change the page, but it changes how it is interpreted by assistive devices. For users with disabilities, this can make a huge difference.  
       For example, a custom button built from a <code>div</code> might not be recognized as a button by a screen reader.  
       By adding ARIA roles and labels, developers ensure it is correctly announced. This goes a long way in improving usability.  
       This makes websites navigable and understandable for users who cannot see the screen.  
       Without ARIA, many advanced web interfaces would be confusing or unusable.</p>

    <p>Overall, WAI-ARIA is a crucial tool for making web applications inclusive.  
       It allows developers to create rich, interactive experiences without leaving anyone behind. Most times companies tend to overlook accessibility until it’s too late in the development process.  
       By integrating ARIA from the start, developers can ensure their applications are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.  
       Learning ARIA helps you understand how accessibility works under the hood and why it is an essential part of professional web development.  
       I found that once you start applying it, your sites feel more polished and considerate for all users.  
       It is both a technical and a human-centered solution.</p>
