    <h2>Reflection from Lab02</h2>
    <p>
      In Lab02, I learned the basics of HTML. I used headings, paragraphs, and links to make my first webpage. It helped me see how web pages are built and how structure matters.

    <h2>Reflection for Lab03</h2>
    <p>
      In Lab03, I learned how to use CSS to style my page. I added colors, borders, and practiced using both a class and an ID selector. It was cool to see how CSS makes the page look way better and easier to read. I feel more confident now that I can make my pages look nicer.
